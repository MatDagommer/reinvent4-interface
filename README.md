# REINVENT GUI

Welcome to the REINVENT GUI project!

This repository aims to create a minimalistic graphical user interface (GUI) for REINVENT users to easily set up and run experiments. REINVENT is a powerful tool for de novo molecular design, and this GUI will make it more accessible to researchers and scientists who prefer a visual approach to creating and managing their experiments.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to simplify the process of creating REINVENT experiments by providing a user-friendly interface. This GUI will allow users to:

- Configure experiment parameters
- Set up reward components
- Manage input and output files
- Visualize results

By streamlining the experiment creation process, we hope to make REINVENT more accessible to a wider audience and accelerate drug discovery research.
